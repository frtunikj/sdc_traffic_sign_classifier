## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

This repo contains the code written to complete the second project "Classifying traffic signs" on Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree. This project consists of algorithms that analyze training (including validation and test) data, pre-processing of data and finally a convolutional neural network architecture that classify traffic signs.

Overview
---
In this project, you will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

About the project
---
An explanation of the processing pipeline for classifying traffic signs, as well as suggestions for further improvements can be found [here](https://github.com/frtunikj/sdc_traffic_sign_classifier/blob/master/writeup.md). 

The Jupyter file containing the project code is [sdc_traffic_sign_classifier](https://github.com/frtunikj/sdc_traffic_sign_classifier/blob/master/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb).


Project environment installation
---
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

**Dataset and Repository**

1. Download the data set. The classroom has a link to the data set in the "Project Instructions" content. This is a pickled dataset in which we've already resized the images to 32x32. It contains a training, validation and test set.
2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
jupyter notebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb
```
